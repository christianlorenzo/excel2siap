# excel2siap
This app takes specific format excel files (from accounts programs like Tango, etc) and exports txt files formated to be imported by AFIP's app COMPRAS (Argentina)
To do:
  * error handling
  * set the pandas dataframe in a global variable - Actually is loaded two times, spending the double of time
